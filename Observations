Observations

1. The negative latitude of the graph from City Latitude vs. Max Temperature had lower amounts of data based 
on the insignificant amount of cities in the lower hemisphere. 

2. There seems to be no real correlation in humidity between the different cities in the City Latitude vs. Humidity 
graph based on latitude. This can also be said of the cloudiness among the different cities. Where there is no 
direct correlation of cloudiness to weather patterns. 

3. From the sample of cities that are based on City Latitude vs. Wind Speed have below a 10 mph wind speed. 
That means that most of the globe is not windy and this variation of wind speed did not show a difference in other 
win conditions.
